# Project documentation

This folder contains Markdown notes that are meant to live alongside the routines source.

- `best-practices/` – workspace for converting selected Aurora docs to Markdown.
- `changelog.md` – running log of Aurora framework updates copied from the community feed.

Use the downloader script with `--format markdown` if you want to refresh the curated references in this directory.
